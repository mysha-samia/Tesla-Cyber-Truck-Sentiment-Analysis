This project is analyzing the Tesla cyber truck which is an all-electric battery-powered light commercial vehicle in development by Tesla, Inc. Tesla Cyber truck is built with an exterior shell made for ultimate durability and passenger protection. Starting with a nearly impenetrable exoskeleton, every component is designed for superior strength and endurance, from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass. The powerful drivetrain and low center of gravity provides extraordinary traction control and torqueenabling acceleration from 0-60 mph in as little as 2.9 seconds and up to 500 miles of range [2]. With the advanced natural language processing we can easily analyze the sentiment for the tesla cyber truck. In the context of a twitter sentiment analysis, at its simplest, sentiment analysis quantifies the mood of a tweet or comment by counting the number of positive and negative words. By subtracting the negative from the positive, the sentiment score is generated. Our project will do exploratory data analysis using python and its library which are pandas, matplotlib, numpy and seaborn
